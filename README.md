<h1> Installation instructions for Stata</h1>

This package extends the Stata `mhtexp` package, and can be installed by placing the mhtexp2.ado and mhtexp2.sthlp files in your stata installationâ€™s "personal ado" folder. The location of your personal ado folder can be found using the stata command `personal`; for additional information, see here: https://www.stata.com/manuals13/u17.pdf#u17.7

Once installed, the package can be used by running the following command, from any do-file or console:
 
`mhtexp2 y, treatment(treatment_var) controls(control_var1 control_var2)`
 
Other than the new "controls" option, the options available are generally the same as the original mhtexp (available on ssc as `mhtexp`, and also at https://github.com/seidelj/mht).
